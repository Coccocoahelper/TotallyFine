# TotallyFine
This is an Ornithe 1.8.9 partial port of Sodium Extra, with a menu inspired by OptiFine's (using AxolotlClientConfig). Currently, it has the following features:

- Detail options (from Celeritas Extra, Sodium Extra, and my own work)
- Player model options (from my own work)
- Disable text shadows option (from moehreag's mod)
- Render item in hand option (from my own work)

It currently requires Java 21 or higher, because yes.
