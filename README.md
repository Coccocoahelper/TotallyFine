# TotallyFine
This is an Ornithe 1.8.9 partial port of Sodium Extra, with a menu inspired by OptiFine's (by using AxolotlClient Config, which also has the benefit of a search button!).

Currently, it has the following features:

- Detail options (from Celeritas Extra, Sodium Extra, and my own work)
- Particle culling (from Legacy VanillaFix)
- Player model options (from my own work)
- Disable text shadows option (from moehreag's mod)
- Render item in hand option (from my own work)

Some goals are:

- Integration with a future MCPatcher replacement mod (either by me or not, I don't mind)
- Fully replacing the Vanilla video settings menu, which includes having its options integrated
- Leaf culling??
- Integration with more performance mods, in the future

It currently requires Java 21 or higher, because yes.
